# adjusted_r2_score  

A lightweight and simple Python package to calculate the **adjusted R-squared score**, a key metric for evaluating the goodness-of-fit of regression models.  

The adjusted RÂ² penalizes the RÂ² score for adding independent variables that do not significantly improve the model's explanatory power, making it a more reliable metric for model selection.
